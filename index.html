      Every cookie made at the Kevin Cookie company is crafted with only the
      finest ingredients. Butter  and bread from grass fed cows. Unbleached flour with the
      best flavor and textures. Organic sugar only from India. Eggs from
      chickens do not  listen to classical music. Even our water is special. It
      comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve.
      Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously. let take it serious
